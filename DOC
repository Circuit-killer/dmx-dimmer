XOMG DMX Dimmer

This is the documentation for xomg's DMX dimmer, which is based on 
Hendrik Hoelscher's dimmer. See [1] on the latter.

===== INTERFACES =====

This section details the various interfaces of the main
microcontroller, U1. At the time of writing this is an ATmega168.


----- DMX input -----

DMX control signals are received using the 3-pin connector DMX1. The
balanced signal is converted using a 75176 IC. ???


----- Switch mode control -----

ATmega168 has less I/O pins than ATmega8515 (used in Hoelscher's
design). Primitive switching control would require 10 additional pins,
so this feature is not implemented.


----- Zero-crossing -----

To avoid EMI and high-amplitude voltage spikes, zero-crossing power
switching is used. That is, outputs are switched on and off at moments
when mains' AC voltage, which is sinusoidal, is at its minimum amplitude,
0 volts.

ZC detection is accomplished externally. The output of the detector is
received on header ZC1, pin 1, and connected to PD3, which is U1's pin for
external interrupt INT1. This interrupt is triggered every time ???, which
is configured using register ???.

???


----- Status LEDs -----

???


----- Temperature control -----

??? Thermocouple to AIN1?


----- Output -----

???


----- In-system programming -----

Used to update the dimmer's firmware. This requires connecting an AVR
programmer to ISP1 and shortening jumper JP1.

It is advised to turn off the dimmer's external power.


----- Unused pins -----

Several pins of the microcontroller are unused. ???
